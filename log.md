### Day 1: December 29, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I worked on twitchtv project, having issues.

**Thoughts** Having problems getting fcc api to work and cannot seem to get a client id.  Everything seems needlessly convoluated. Don't like having to sign up for stuff.  Twitchtv website irritating me.  Will have to work through it. Did Roman Numeral Converter.  Worked MTM2017 Part 3, Challenge 15

### Day 2: December 30, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I worked on twitchtv project - progress (happy dance).

**Thoughts** MTM2017 part 3, challenge 15 vexing me, deadline tomorrow and no clue how to progress.  Worked "Wherefore art thou" code in freeCodeCamp and worked more on twitchtv.  Feeling good about progress there.
