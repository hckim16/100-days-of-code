### Day 1: December 29, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I worked on twitchtv project, having issues.

**Thoughts** Having problems getting fcc api to work and cannot seem to get a client id.  Everything seems needlessly convoluated. Don't like having to sign up for stuff.  Twitchtv website irritating me.  Will have to work through it. Did Roman Numeral Converter.  Worked MTM2017 Part 3, Challenge 15
