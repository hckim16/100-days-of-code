### Day 1: December 29, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I worked on twitchtv project, having issues.

**Thoughts** Having problems getting fcc api to work and cannot seem to get a client id.  Everything seems needlessly convoluated. Don't like having to sign up for stuff.  Twitchtv website irritating me.  Will have to work through it
